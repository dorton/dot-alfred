    "snippet" : "Hey {clipboard},\n\nI hope you are getting ready for a terrific journey!  Next Monday can't get here fast enough.  I wanted to touch base and see how we wanted to arrange the remaining tuition.  We don't have a preferred method of paying, so it's really whatever is most convenient for you.  I can send you a link to pay online if you are paying by credit card.  All other methods can be given directly to Christie.  Simply give her a holler and we will make arrangements. \n\nAs always, please reach out and let us know if there is anything we can do to help, and I want to reiterate how excited we are to get started!\n\nThanks,",
