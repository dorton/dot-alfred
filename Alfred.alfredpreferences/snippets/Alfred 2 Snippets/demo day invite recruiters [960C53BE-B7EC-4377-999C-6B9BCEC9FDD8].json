    "snippet" : "Hey Simon!\n\nI hope all is well. I wanted to see if you were able to stop by TMC|x this Tuesday afternoon for a demo day where our students will be presenting.\n\nHere's the link to RSVP: https:\/\/tiydemo2017.eventbrite.com\/ \n\nIt would be a terrific opportunity to have meaningful conversations with some really great people!\n\nThe best way I can describe how we structure demo days is to think of old school science fairs. You'll be able to have real conversations with students and have some fun doing so.\n\nWe will of course have food\/drinks there for you as well ðŸ˜ƒ.\n\nI hope to see you there!\n\nAlso, I would love it if you would share this with your network as well. I am really proud of our student's work and want to show them off to as many folks as possible.\n\nAgain, I hope you can stop in.  Talk soon.\n\nThanks, ",
